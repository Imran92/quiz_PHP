# quiz_PHP
simple MCQ Quiz app. The admin can set, delete and update questions &amp; answers, check scores. Users can play &amp; check score

This whole project is coded using raw PHP. 

Every page has 5 questions (you can change that to any number). If a user can answer more than 50% correctly, in that case he will be moved
to the next quiz page.

Admins can login and log out. I have implemented session to save the user data and admin data at the time of browsing
